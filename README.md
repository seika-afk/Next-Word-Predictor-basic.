# Predict Next Word using RNN

This project trains an RNN model to predict the next word in a sentence using a corpus of text. The model uses an embedding layer, a SimpleRNN layer, and a dense output layer with softmax.

## Features
- Tokenizes and sequences input text
- Trains model on sequences to predict next word
- One-hot encodes target output
- Generates text based on a seed input

## Model Architecture
- Embedding Layer
- SimpleRNN Layer
- Dense Output Layer

## Requirements
- TensorFlow / Keras


## Usage
1. Load and preprocess text
2. Train model
3. Generate text with trained model
